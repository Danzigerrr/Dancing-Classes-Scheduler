## Possible profiles of the user
**Dancing Pair:**
- chosing coaches - how much time with particular coach
- time availability (date and time)


**Dancing Coach:**
- time availability (date and time)
- group workshop in the afternoon
- practice in the evening


**Organizator:**
- create the event - specify the location, dates, and number of rooms for trainings
- create list of coaches and their time availability (date and time)
- create the first part of the schedule - time of the group workshop and the coach responsible for that
- define at what time is the lunch break

The quicker the pair fills out the event sign up form, the higher priority they will get in the schedule.

The regular size of one training time slot is 45 minutes.
